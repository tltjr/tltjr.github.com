As of today, the prototype of [Wish](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/20258791/wish) is available for download.  

If you are unfamiliar with Wish or would like an overview of the features, please see our [Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/20258791/wish) for a description and a video demonstration. Wish is the ultimate command line experience for Windows; featuring tabs, panes, syntax highlighting and improved tab completion.

**Many features are currently exposed by right clicking the user interface (or using the key bindings revealed in the right-click context menu).**

This is only a prototype, so you'll have to be a little forgiving of the quality and limited features, but this should provide a good introduction and feel for the vision.

Things that Work (mostly)
----------------------------
+ Wish's popup based tab completion
+ Powershell engine (limited)
+ cmd engine (limited)
+ Ctrl + R for command history searching
+ up/down arrow command history
+ Ctrl + D for recent directory searching
+ Ctrl + A for recent argument searching
+ Tabs/Panes
   

Things that Don't Work
-------------------------
+ Most features are incomplete
+ Git Bash support
+ Visual Studio Command Prompt support
+ No settings or customization available
