It has been one week since [Wish](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/20258791/wish) was announced on Kickstarter. There have been lots of ups and downs and great feedback has been pouring in, so I thought I'd share some takeaways.

The Good
--------
The best part of the experience by far has been the all the feedback. Feature requests began rolling in immediately and give me a great sense of what will be important to users (apparently background transparency is an absolute must have). I wish I had done this earlier for this reason alone. 

As far as raising money, the highlight of the last week was definitely this tweet:

That tweet happened while I was sleeping and I was treated to a full inbox when I woke up.

The Bad
-------
The initial Kickstarter post gained little to no traction on any new aggregators. Here is a summary:

r/programming: -2  
r/Windows: 14  
Hacker News: 7

Those sources did generate some good pledges despite their limited reach.

The Ugly
--------
So far, pledges are tracking well below goal. I have also received a lot of feedback that I am attempting to raise too much. This is a fair criticism. It was difficult to come up with goal amount, but I picked a number that would make me confident I could deliver a great product. Ultimately, if the project doesn't fund, it isn't nearly as large a failure as if it funded, but I could not deliver.  

Overall, I have really enjoyed the Kickstarter process. I love interacting with potential users and getting feedback on my application. If I ever considered another Kickstarter project, I'd make an effort to get a decent prototype in order and begin getting feedback on it immediately. I also regret not bringing more people to the table initially. It would have been very helpful to have a handful of users of the prototype that could help me promote and give feedback on the site.  

Most importantly, thank you very much to everyone who has pledged so far. Your pledges are greatly appreciated. We have a long way to go, but it should be a fun and exciting ride.  

If you haven't pledged yet, and would like to, please see our [Kickstarter page](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/20258791/wish).
